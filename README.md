Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game originated from China, usually played between two people in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes that are:
1) Rock which can be done by a closed fist
2) Paper which can be done by a flat hand
3) Scissors which can be done by forming a V with two fingers aka V sign.

RULES
Player whose choice is Rock over Scissors wins 1 point since Rock can destroy Scissors.
Player whose choice is Paper over Rock wins 1 point since Paper can cover Rock.
Player whose choice is Scisors over Paper wins 1 point since Scissors can cut Paper.

I implement this exercise in order to put skills I learned from TOP(The Odin Project) foundations courses at work.

Enjoy the game!
